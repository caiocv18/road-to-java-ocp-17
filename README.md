# Road to Java OCP 17: A Journey of Learning and Practice

Welcome to the "road-to-java-ocp-17" repository, a space dedicated to documenting my journey to master Java and achieve the Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 17 certification. Here, you'll find a comprehensive record of the exercises and coding challenges I'm undertaking on leading programming learning platforms:

1. CodeSignal
2. Codewars
3. Exercism
4. HackerRank
5. LeetCode

This repository is not just a place to store solutions to coding challenges, but also a space to apply and solidify the concepts learned in the OCP 17 course and the Study Guide OCP 17. Through this effort, I aim not only to effectively prepare for the certification but also to deeply understand the new features and improvements introduced in Java SE 17.

In addition to being a personal study and practice resource, this repository is intended to serve as a reference in articles I will be writing throughout my studies. By sharing my progress, I hope to offer insights, tips, and strategies that can help other developers on their own Java learning journeys.
